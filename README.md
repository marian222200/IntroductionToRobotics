<br>
The homework consists of the following:

• Components:  RBG led (1 minimum), potentiometers (3 minimum), resistors and wires (per logic)

• Technical Task: Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the colors of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics (you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the led.

• Publishing task: You must add the code to the Github repo and continue updating the readme with at least the following details (but feel free to be more creative):
1.  Task Requirements
2.  Picture of the setup
3.  Link to video showcasing functionality (I recommend youtube,  but anything I can access is fine)

• Coding task: Coding style is of utmost importance.  You must have a perfectly clean code in order to receive the maximum grade.  Keep in mind that magic numbers are not accepted, although you might see them in the lab (as a trade-off for speed).  Remember to be consistent in your style, check  the  style  guide  and  the  provided  style  document  and  use  correct spacing.
